# Smart Statement Reader Documentation

## 1. Introduction
The Smart Statement Reader aims to streamline the process of extracting financial data from PDFs, enhancing efficiency and accuracy through AI/ML technologies.

## 2. Objectives
- Directly process PDFs from ERP/accounting systems.
- Automatically detect and classify PDF formats.
- Extract financial ledger entries into Excel or CSV.
- Reduce manual intervention through high accuracy and self-learning.

## 3. Problem Solution
### 3.1. Input and Output
- **Input**: Raw PDF files containing accounting data.
- **Output**: Structured formats (Excel/CSV) with accurate financial data.

### 3.2. Core Features
1. **PDF Ingestion**:
    - Accepts PDF files directly from accounting systems.

2. **AI/ML Models**:
    - **Structure Detection**: Detects and classifies the structure of PDF files (e.g., column layouts, headers, naming conventions).
    - **Data Extraction**: Extracts financial entries with high accuracy.
    - **Layout Handling**: Adapts to variations and inconsistencies in document layouts.
    - **Self-learning**: Improves extraction accuracy based on user feedback over time.
    - **File Grouping**: Classifies PDFs based on detected formats for streamlined processing.

3. **User Feedback Mechanism**:
    - Provides a confidence score for extracted data accuracy.
    - Highlights low-confidence entries for user review.
    - Allows users to provide feedback to train the model iteratively.

4. **Data Export**:
    - Exports processed data into structured formats (Excel/CSV).
## 4. Implementation
